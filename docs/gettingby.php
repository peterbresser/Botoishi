 <b>Restaurants</b> - 
A lot of Restaurants have picture menus  . The more local restaurants/izakayas are Japanese language only ,dont take offence that you may not be able to get a table , 
the Japanese tend to not want to cause offence because they dont speak English , so its less offesive if they dont 
interact with a non japanese speaker

<b>Tipping</b><br>
Tipping is Not a practice , dont try and do it , refusal may lead to offence.
<br>
<b>Otoshi</b> -   is a small appetizer given once you place an order at a bar .You can think of a it like a cover charge, table charge, 
or service charge that comes with some food in return. <br>
It might be a bowl of nuts,fried chicken skin,  edamame, rice crackers, miso soup, picked vegetables or  tofu , it will vary .
</br>It’s primarily seen in bars, izakaya, and restaurants where the primary theme of the place 
leans more toward drinking . It will not likely be on the menu , it will just be served. Its an accepted custom , you will not see in
family restaurants , food focused places or fast food chains<br>
Its not a scam  , its the way that bars work ( and izakayas ). Its generally between 300 to 800 yen.

 <b>Onsen</b> - 
Traditional Japanese bathing. So much is written about etiquette and dos/donts . Its pretty basic:
<br>There are red (Female) and blue (Male) curtains to enter by, check the open/close times before hand
<br><img src=".$GLOBALS['URLOCATION']."/images/curtain.webp>
<br>Read any signs before entering
<br><br>Get undressed/dressed in the changing room  (datsuijo) , most will have a locker (with keys) or shelves to store your stuff
<bR>You must wash your self at the washing station before entering the baths . Establishments supply all your washing needs
<br>Enjoy
<br><br>Once done back int eh chnaging room you usually find everything you need
<br>Public onsens you need to bring your own needs but hotels always supply eveything from comb to toothbrush to hairdryers
 
<br>Usually by the third or fourth time you get the hang of it, but always check the signs as conditions do vary.

  <b>Mobile Data   </b> <br> 
These days E-Sim is the easiest way  , I not used a sim/esim when traveling, I use the free wifi at Hotels and  Japan Tourist Information Centers . 
 <br>
<br>I would recommend  <a href=\'https://www.sakuramobile.jp/lp/?i=travel-sim\' target =_blank  style=text-decoration:none; class=text-blue> Sakura Mobile </a>, only because I have dealt withem for the past 25 years in the Telco industry and they are an excellent company to deal with<center><img src='images/spacer.gif' width =20px >

  <b>Post Office</b> <br> 
Japan Post offices are as prevelant as kombini . We found it the best place to for ATM service, Easy to understandand use <br>
<br>
We found it great way to reduce the amount of souvniers we have to transport around, as soon as we reached an uncumfortable level to manage we will go the post office and ship off a box home of all the best goodies (we have sent back bottles Sake without any issue)

<b>Booking</b> -  always book where you can , do not take offence that you cannot get a seat or a rooom ,
 the Japanese tend to not want to cause offence because they dont speak English , so its less offesive if they dont 
 interact with a non japanese speaker . In resaurants you may  find clip boards out the front to make a reservation for the next avaibale table,
 you will still need to waity till your name is called .Use it, 
 translate your name to japanese ( katanya  - romanised english) , <a href='katakanya.php'>Katakanya characters</a>
 NOT in you own language .
